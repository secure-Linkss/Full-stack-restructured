# BACKEND AUDIT - Full-stack-restructured vs Secure_links

## Comparing Backend Structures

### Full-stack-restructured (NEW - KEEP THIS)
- api/routes: 39 Python files
- api/models: 66 subdirectories
- api/services: 38 subdirectories
- api/middleware: 11 subdirectories
- More comprehensive structure

### Secure_links (OLD - REFERENCE ONLY)
- src/routes: 34 Python files
- src/models: 16 files
- src/services: 10 files
- Simpler structure

## Analysis
The Full-stack-restructured backend is MORE comprehensive.
Need to verify quantum redirect exists in Full-stack-restructured.
